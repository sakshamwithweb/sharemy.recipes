**A fullstack website that lets one records or upload any cooking video then the ai analyses and make shareable recipe**


## How does it work
User uploads video → Stored in S3 → /upload sent to Memories.ai → Wait until video parsed → Use /chat to generate recipe → Show recipe to user.

Here's a test video(credis goes to @CookTubeOfficial YT):https://github.com/sakshamwithweb/sharemy.recipes/raw/refs/heads/main/public/test.mp4
